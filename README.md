<b>Note:</b>
Hi there, I've created my portfolio by using bootstrap. I can't remember why Ron asked us to have portfolio section only occupying 2/3 of page so I just make whatever I think would work and I like. I've also shown contact form section occupying 2/3 of div. please note that content are froom my worlplace and just placeholders for now. will also update bio in the next round.

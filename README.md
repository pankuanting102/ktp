<b>Note:</b>
<br>Hi there, I've created my portfolio by using bootstrap, html and css. I can't remember why Ron asked us to have portfolio section only occupying 2/3 of page so I just make whatever I think would work aesthitcally. I've also shown contact form section occupying 2/3 of div. please note that content are from my worlplace and just placeholders for now. will also update bio in as I have more concrete idea of what i want to convey.
